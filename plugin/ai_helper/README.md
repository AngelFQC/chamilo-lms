AI Helper plugin
======

Version 1.0

> This plugin is meant to be later integrated into Chamilo (in a major version
release).

The AI helper plugin integrates into parts of the platform that seem the most useful to teachers/trainers or learners. 
Because available Artificial Intelligence (to use the broad term) now allows us to ask for meaningful texts to be generated, we can use those systems to pre-generate content, then let the teacher/trainer review the content before publication.
