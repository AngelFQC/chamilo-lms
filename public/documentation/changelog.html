    <h1>Chamilo 2.0 alpha 1 - [release name not defined],  2024-07-05</h1>
    <h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
    <p>Chamilo 2.0 is a major release that starts a new branch for the Chamilo software.
    It is based on Chamilo 1.11.10 and includes tons of backend changes that will make
    developing Chamilo more "mainstream" in the future, by adopting more widely-known libraries,
    with the notable inclusions of Symfony as a main controller and framework (except for
    some legacy tools not yet converted) and VueJS as our main frontend framework.<br />
    For the first time in more than 14 years (since its launch in 2010),
    Chamilo changes appearance, with a new and streamlined (open source) set of
    icons, and a design that will allow more flexibility and speed across devices.</p>
    <h3>Release name</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"></a>Not assigned yet</p>

    <h3>Security fixes</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>None</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Added</h3>.
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Messages: Messaging can now be made to several people at once from the messages interface (and replies can be made to the same users).</li>
        <li>Added <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a> endpoint "/api". See <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/wiki/webservices-api-latest">wiki</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Changed</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Database: All "name" fields have been renamed "title" for consistency across the system.</li>
        <li>Database: As much as possible, tables containing records that had been deleted in Chamilo 1.* are migrated without such records. This means less "ghost" content, but also that the content deleted that way in Chamilo 1.* now has become completely unrecoverable.</li>
        <li>Messages: Message attachment are no longer replicated the number of times they are received (for example through an announcement). This saves considerable space on large portals.</li>
        <li>Plugins: Many plugins that seemed either unused or were not maintained by their maintainers. They could be included later on, and their tables have not been removed in the database, but they are not available in the list of plugins.</li>
        <li>Wiki: The wiki tool is not available *yet*. It will be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Blogs: The blogs tool is not available. It might be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Dropbox: The dropbox tool is not available. It might be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Global: Sub-folder mode: Chamilo 2 will not support being installed in a sub-folder. Nowadays, defining a subdomain has become very easy and provides higher security and more configuration flexibility, and supporting sub-folders is a complex task.</li>
        <li>Display: Upon migration, the stylesheets are reset to the default Chamilo stylesheet. You will have to redesign your stylesheets using the stylesheets tool in the admin UI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Known issues</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>DB title vs name fields: There have been *many* (several hundreds) database changes between v1.* and v2.0. These changes include renaming all "name" fields in all tables to "title", to follow a common standard. This particular change has required dozens of hours of expert work, because the "name" text is very common and the Chamilo 1.* was not *that* well structured. However, we may still have missed a few ones. If you find one, please report it as an issue in our repository.</li>
        <li>Customizations of in-course tools (titles, icons, etc) at the course level are lost in migration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Syntax and terminology</h2>
    <p>To ensure this changelog is the most useful, we are using a specific syntax and terms for this changelog, provided below.<br />>
    Also, this changelog, to the exception of security fixes, only contains elements that have an impact on users. Sysadmins and developers are invited to use git log to find any specific change.</p>
    <h3>Versions</h3>
    <div>
        Each version is shortly described, with:
    <ul>
        <li>a version number using <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a></li>
        <li>a version name, which is the name of a town or village visited at least once by one of our development team members, preferably with a link to the place in OpenStreetmap or on Wikipedia</li>
        <li>a release date</li>
        <li>an optional, short history explaining the relationship between the version and the place</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Sections</h3>
    <div>
        Inside each version block, different sections are laid out to ease the reading of the changelog:
        <ul>
            <li>Security fixes: any known vulnerability was fixed in this version.</li>
            <li>Added: New features. Big & small.</li>
            <li>Changed: Processes that have changed or improved. Might require power users to be trained on these changes. Includes breaking changes requiring special attention from admins. Includes removals.</li>
            <li>Fixed: Any known issue that has been fixed. These are not considered improvements because they should have worked in the first place.</li>
        </ul>
        Within those sections, you will find different markers helping you filtering out specific topics like theming, web services, database, etc.<br />
    </div>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <div>
        Every change comes with a link to the change in our versions tracking system, a link to the reported issue or task (if any) and a short description of the change's purpose or effect.<br />
        A commit message will typically show as follows:
        <pre>
    [Minor: ][Tool: ][Subtool: ][Description][ - refs #1234]
        </pre>
        where:
        <ul>
            <li>[Minor :] can be added or not. If added, this will *not* appear in the changelog because... it's a minor, non-process-affecting change.</li>
            <li>[Tool: ] is one of the tools/features below.</li>
            <li>[Subtool: ] is usually used only when the tool is "Plugin: ", to indicate which plugin we're talking about.</li>
            <li>[Description] is a short sentence (verbs like 'add', 'remove', 'change' are not conjugated, so they appear as these infinitive versions without the English 'to') describing the change.</li>
            <li>[ - refs #1234] indicates the ID of the issue on Github (or something like 'BT#1234' if from another, private, ticketing system)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Tools/features terminology</h3>
    <div>
        We use a short terminology to group all changes applying to the same tool. We use a term in singular even when talking about multiples. The names we use for these tools/features are:
        <ul>
            <li>Admin</li>
            <li>Announcement</li>
